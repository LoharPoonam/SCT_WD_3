<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to compete on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before your opponent.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML5:</strong> For structuring the game interface.</li>
    <li><strong>CSS3:</strong> For styling the game board and layout.</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> For game logic and player interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two-player functionality on a 3x3 grid.</li>
    <li>Real-time updates to track player moves.</li>
    <li>Win detection for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal patterns.</li>
    <li>Option to restart the game after a win or a draw.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
    - Players take turns marking X or O in one of the 9 available spaces.<br>
    - The game checks for a winner after each move.<br>
    - If a player completes a row, column, or diagonal, they win, and the game announces the result.<br>
    - If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.<br>
    - Players can click the "Restart" button to start a new game.
